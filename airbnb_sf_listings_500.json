        "neighborhood_overview": "We love Noe Valley. It is a wonderful friendly upscale neighborhood. There is a terrific mix of people who live here, many commute to Silicon Valley via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) busses that stop a few blocks away from our home. There are lots of charming stores and restaurants within walking distance and our location makes it easily accessible to all parts of San Francisco by public transportation. Noe Valley also has more dogs (pets) than any other part of San Francisco.",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Bernal Heights was voted the best San Francisco neighborhood to live in.   It's a village within a city with lovely views, cafes & restaurants, parks, a library, a great bakery and grocery stores.   If you enjoy running or hiking, it's a perfect place to visit because you get the best of both worlds.  Also right down the hill is the Mission District which is chock-filled with restaurants, clubs and shops.  The top of Bernal Heights offers a spectacular 360 degree view of the city and the bay.  For those who have a car, there is plenty  free street parking on Ripley or adjacent streets in Bernal Heights during the day.  In the evenings, when neighbors return from work you may have to park in adjacent streets in the neighborhood.  Staying in  Bernal Heights during your visit to San Francisco will make you feel like you are an \"insider\" rather than a visitor living in a hotel downtown.",

I have lived abroad in East Africa and traveled in Europe and Central/South America. I love learning about new places to visit, especially coastal spots and warm spots, and trying new foods.  Our profile pictures are shots of us traveling in Mexico, Spain, France and Armenia.\r\n\r\nWe live in this apartment too, so you will see us hanging out in the kitchen and common areas.  Our bedroom is towards the back of the house, while the three guest rooms are in the front of the house.  I try to balance visiting with guests and having alone time.  The house tends to be pretty quiet and mellow. We specifically do not rent to couples so that there are a max of three guests at any time.\r\nSebouh lives downstairs and you will see him occasionally. He speaks fluent Armenian and is a plumber and works out of our house, so he comes and goes throughout the day. ",

Gorgeous views of downtown from front terrace. Walk to Haight-Ashbury, Golden Gate Park, the Castro, Alamo Square (Painted Ladies), Hayes Valley.  Walk to grocery, cafes & restaurants. Great urban hiking from house. Buses and subway within 2 blocks.  Free parking at the house, see full description for details.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Authentic and renovated 1890 Victorian (one of those tourists come here to gaze at), in a central location yet on a safe, quiet and charming tree-lined street, with attractions, food, shopping and public transportation within walking distance. Top rated location in town. While our street is quiet, it's one block from Haight St & 1/2 block to Divisadero St. Lots of fun shopping, cafes, grocery stores, bakeries and restaurants within short walking distance.  <br /><br />The house ",
        "neighborhood_overview": "The neighborhood is simply beautiful, with restored late 1800/early 1900's Victorians all around.  Buena Vista Park is just a couple of blocks up the hill surrounded by amazing archictectural gems and breathtaking views of the city and the bay.  Duboce Park a block away is also surrounded by such quaint beautiful houses that they are on the tour bus route (those buses avoid our block because of our short  hill, keeping this section of our street a quiet secret!)  Yet with Haight St and Divisadero just a block away, public transportation, grocery stores, cafes and restaurants abound within a short walk.",

I really enjoy sharing my house and my city.\r\nMy husband and I love family, friends, music, nature, great food and wine, old movies, sports.  We are hikers, birders and world travelers.  We appreciate cultural diversity and individual uniqueness.\r\nMy motto:  Dream it, love it, expect it, and you will experience it!",

Email if you have questions, especially if your requested dates are in the near term and I will do my best to work with you!\r\n\r\nHaving spent more time than I care to remember in sterile, uninviting hotel rooms, I was initially attracted to vacation rentals as refreshing, and often more affordable, alternatives.  What I found were the same white walls and beige furniture or, even worse, cluttered rooms and Aunt Edna's donated dilapidated couch in the living room.  Well, welcome to something different.  Take a break from your busy schedule by relaxing in clean, inviting rental that that feels enough like home that you're immediately comfortable while being so special you'll look forward to your return.  Many of my guests have been back 2 or 3 times, and some have found themselves venturing across the country to check out another Red Hot Vacation Rental.  \r\n\r\nMy places are located in Chicago, Miami Beach and San Francisco. I've lived in all 3 cities and am happy to suggest hidden local gems or recommend the best nearby dry cleaner.    \r\n",

The neighborhood has changed a lot over the years.  Its been the home to many groups of people (including the Swedes...Cafe Du Nord) and of course is best known today for it's Gay Pride.  There is a reason it's called \"gay\" because it's about being happy and loving life! We do that in the Castro:)",

I've lived in the Midwest and East Coast in the US as well as in Latin America, Western and Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. I was a university student in Spain, a Peace Corps volunteer in Paraguay, and a humanitarian aid worker in Bosnia, Serbia, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. \n\nI'm also an antiques dealer - for vintage, salvage, and upcycled furniture, decor, and jewelry. My home features many objects & artifacts I've collected or repurposed over the years. One of my favorite pastimes is poking around sidewalk sales and thrift stores... but some of my treasures were just as likely found 'free online' or on the street corner. \n\nI'd love for you to come check out my place!

You will find a kitchen that is compact, efficient & chef clad surrounded by a dining room, living room, two bedrooms and a bathroom that have all been lovingly curated by us both. \nDuring Covid we both 'worked from home' and were grateful to have this very spacious home in Palm Springs. We managed to integrate it into a magical 'work from home' space offering two dedicated work spaces... one in the master bedroom on a 1960's Paul Puccio pink Onyx desk or additional large L-Shaped work space and the second more formal work desk in another bedroom whereby we custom built a 7' marble desk.

My past research and scholarship includes issues relating to the intersection of law with race, gender and sexuality.  I grew up in Australia but have been living in the U.S. over twenty years.  I love to cook and travel.  Local Farmers Markets are among my favorite places to visit.\n\nHaving lived in North Beach in San Francisco for over a decade, I know the City and neighborhoods (especially Little Italy and Chinatown) quite well.  So, if you have any special travel desires or if you need any advice about visiting San Francisco, I'd be more than happy to help you plan a special experience or event.  Just drop me a line before you arrive.  Ask me about my favorite Happy Hour spots!",

We strive to make your stay with us a five-star experience.\r\n\r\nWe have lived in our home for over 25 years and every day we feel fortunate that we live in beautiful San Francisco.  Our children were raised in our great neighborhood, the Inner Sunset district, and many of our neighbors are longtime friends. We're excited to share the wonders of the city to all who visit our SF Suite.\r\n\r\nBoth of us are career media professionals who have joyfully  transitioned to working in community arts organizations.  \r\n\r\nWe have visited many places in the U.S. and abroad  and our many travel experiences have given us great insight in how to host. We have always enjoyed staying in private spaces to get a feel for how the locals live. On our travels we have enjoyed cooking our own meals as well as eating out. Hopefully our guests will benefit from what we've learned along the way about hospitality and comfort. \r\n\r\nOur hosting style is service-oriented but not intrusive, where your privacy and comfort is our priority. We live on the premises, above the suite and are always available to help our guests have the best stay possible.  We look forward to meeting you!\r\n\r\n~Syl and Art\r\n",

        "neighborhood_overview": "Nestled at the base of Bernal Hill and half a block from Precita Park, this part of Bernal Heights is close to Muni, BART, and the Mission. Precita Park Cafe is 100 steps from the apartment, while nearby Harvest Hills Market offers organic delights.<br /><br />The apartment is walking distance from many restaurants, bars and shopping. We are one block from the Mission, known for its great dining (including the best burritos in the world), cool bars and unique shopping. It's a perfectly flat walk into the Mission from the apartment so no need to worry about hills in that direction. <br /><br />Walk South and you will end up on Bernal Hill with 360 degree views of the city (from the very top) and a cool hill top swing that has you soaring over rooftops and flying over a magnificent view of downtown. A little further and you arrive at Cortland Ave, our little village with quaint restaurants and shops.",

I live with my partner, Christian and I have two grown kids - both who live on their own.\n\nI love to read, paint and walk. I'm a huge Outlander and Jane Austen fan. Besides San Francisco, Paris is my favorite city. I haven't traveled as much as I'd like - I'm hoping to do a lot more in the future. My guests inspire me to see the world! \n\n2023 marks my 11th year as a host! I had no idea what to expect when I started, but I really love it and when you visit you will see that I put my heart and soul into the apartment and making sure you have a great stay.\n\nI have lived in Bernal Heights since 1991 and I adore it. It's a really cute neighborhood with lots of great, thoughtful people. \n\nThe apartment is an in-law in my house. It used to be my office until I realized that I really only need a computer to work and the space was going to waste. A friend came in and redesigned the space for me specifically as a vacation rental (I helped!) and he did a beautiful job. \n\nHosting happy guests is my number one priority and all the good reviews really make my day.

        "host_about": "I'm a Bay Area Serial Internet Entrepreneur, best known for Match Online Dating, TrustArc, and now BabyQuip, baby equipment rental marketplace.   I enjoy meeting new entrepreneurs and  business people as well as tourists and work hard to be sure everyone has a positive experience in my home.  \n\nMy homes are in cities named by the Spanish for Saint Francis of Assisi:  San Francisco and Santa Fe  (Santa Fe's full name is  La Villa Real de la Santa Fé de San Francisco de Asís (“The Royal Town of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisi”).\n\nMy San Francisco home is on Potrero Hill.  I love the home's gardens and fantastic views which you can see from five different patios or decks.  My guests enjoy the combination of luxury and elegance with comfortable charm.\n\nMy other homes are in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where I grew up.  The two homes on Garcia St., Gorgeous on Garcia and Casa Kateri, in the Historic East Side of Santa Fe, are truly \"Santa Fe Style\" with vigas (ceiling beams), Kiva fireplace, wood floors and thick adobe walls.  The setting is spectacular in the heart of old Santa Fe with easy access to the museums, art, hiking trails, and plaza.  Casa Laguna is in the Quail Run resort community in Santa Fe, just a few miles from town.  There you can access the golf course, tennis/pickle ball courts, swimming pool, and wonderful trail system.\n\nAs you can see from my reviews, many first-time Airbnb guests have enjoyed my homes. If you are new to Airbnb (or not) and want to book one of my listings, please consider these 'pro tips' gleaned from my Airbnb experiences...both, as a host and as a guest:\n\n1) Read the Airbnb FAQs thoroughly and feel free to ask questions. Hosts with popular listings appreciate it when prospective guests ask questions unique to their travel situation and/or the listing in question. \n\n2) PLEASE thoroughly read through my listings. I assure you that your questions about parking, public transportation, check in/out, etc. have been included in the listings.\n\n3)  Tell me about yourself.  Since you may have few/no reviews, hosts like me must make a guess as to what sort of guest(s) you might be (and some hosts won't even consider people new to Airbnb). In the absence of a review, you might consider the following to ensure I (other hosts) will feel comfortable approving your request:\n\n• in your initial note, it is appreciated when you include what your plans are during your stay (sightseeing, attending a conference, partying at clubs, etc) \n• include assuring comments about how you will treat my home (i.e. \"I will treat your home with the same respect I treat mine\") \n• let me know you've read the house rules, and that they are agreeable to you (this is a must, please)\n\n4) Finally...I, like other busy hosts, keep my calendar up to date! So, if Airbnb is showing my listings as available for your dates - the place is available! If my listing suits your needs, it is best to send the booking request right off. If you hesitate, the other person looking at my place for your dates will get it!\n\nHope this is helpful. Welcome!",

I've been extremely lucky to have worked most of my career in jobs that are meaningful and dedicated to helping the underserved. I've also had a diversity of jobs...from the first woman to help re-build San Francisco's cable cars, to working with Mayors..i can share lots of insider stories.\n\nHowever, my true love is painting. The house is filled with my paintings and reflects how much I love color. And music, my partner is a musician ..\n\nI am blessed to have raised two amazing children now in their 30's and have just been overjoyed by the arrival of my 3 grandchildren--all the greatest gifts I have ever been graced with. \n\nI'm a fellow world wide traveler and have used airbnb on my own travels so I am sensitive to that delicate balance between giving you your privacy and providing a warm host experience.\n\nI love great food (and can share with you all the best and unknown places to eat), hiking, yoga, art, historical novels, friendship, movies and good conversation.\n\nI love hosting on AirBnB and have met incredible people from all over the world.  I\"m committed to making your stay in San Francisco /Fairfax memorable so please let me know how I can help you while you are here.  ",

So, plan on traveling around the City to sample and dine the diversity of cusine.  <br /><br />The City is roughly a circle-shaped area about 7 miles in diameter with many attractions that to some extent characterize each neighborhood.  Once a reservation is made, I will be able to send you a LINK to an hour long upscale tour of San Francisco.  Airbnb won't allow me to send links before then.",

Not to mention our neighborhood is the warmest, flattest, and fog free part of San Francisco. \n\nWe're 15 minutes from SFO by taxi, a block and a half from the 24th Bart Station and close to many bus and MUNI (subway) lines. Having visited Southeast Asia, Oceania, Australia, Europe, Central America, and of course all over North America, one theme holds true for all our adventures: discover the true culture and flavor wherever we are. \n\nAs your host, we'll do everything we can to make sure you get off the beaten path. We're happy to share our favorite restaurants, local hangouts, and ensure you see the true San Francisco, not just the typical touristy sites. We're into everything from scuba diving, biking, kayaking, hiking, wine, art, music, food, festivals, museums, all things teens, parks, and more. Whatever you're into, we'll point you in the right direction so you have an authentic and memorable time in San Francisco.

I'm also an Ambassador to the World Parkinson Congress, a great organization that is connecting patients, caregivers, doctors, and researchers to find a cure for Parkinson's Disease (PD).  Esther is active in the kids school, and doing lots of volunteer projects to make the world a cleaner, greener, healthier place to live. She also works as an LCC for Cultural Care Au Pair, an agency that connects Au Pairs from around the world with local host families in SF.  \r\n\r\nWe have lived in this neighborhood of San Francisco about 15 years, and love it, and expect you will too...   We love the outdoors, and being close to the beach, Lake Merced, and Golden Gate Park.  Our kids are big fans of FC Barcelona, SF 49ers, Golden State Warriors, and the SF Giants, but we welcome fans of rival teams and will be nice to you too... ;-)",

        "host_about": "I am a physician and I moved to USA 22 years ago. I love what San Francisco city and the Bay Area has to offer. I feel very lucky and privileged to live in a beautiful and safe area of San Francisco called Pacific Heights. \r\n\r\nI am an avid mountaineer/climber and I travel usually once a year, for a month - long expedition trip. That is usually when I open the calendar in AirBnB for my apartment, as well as (separately) for my garage. \r\n\r\nI would like to rent my beautiful home to someone reliable for all that time when I am gone. \r\n\nThe things I can't live without are my family, friends, mountains, my amazing home, nature, meditation and any kind of physical activity daily. \n\r\nMy favorite travel destinations - to many to mention. I feel amazing in high altitude mountains. \n\nI climbed all the highest mountains in the world called Seven Summits (including Mt.Everest), as well as skied to the South Pole.  Beside that, all my travels and expeditions left me with amazing memories. \r\n\nMy favorite books - too many to list here as I  read a lot, but I love the most  \"Master and Margarita\" by Michail Bulhakov. There are many books in my home, so if you have time feel free to read something new. I switched now to ebooks or audiobooks, as it doesn't take any physical space. \r\n\nMy favorite food is prepared with local and organic ingredients - check out many restaurants on Fillmore street - you will have so many to choose from, even after Pandemic years. I love sushi and the best sushi in the city is a walking distance from my home - check out Tataki restaurant (on California street/Divisadero street) - amazing and fresh! \r\nI also would encourage you to check “State Bird Provisions”, but you would need a reservation. It’s a 7 -10 minutes walking distance from my home. Located on Fillmore street. \n\nI travel a lot for business - Marriott hotels, but for fun - I prefer staying in a tent or in a cool Airbnb place in different cities all over the world. \r\n\r\nMy motto in life is to live largely, “on the edge of my comfort zone\", hence climbing or polar expeditions, and now posting my home at Airbnb website. \n\nThroughout the process of renting my home I learn that my HOA’s CC&Rs (Homeowners Rules) do not allow for any short term rentals and I can only rent it for a month or longer. \r\n\r\nMy modern apartment is located on the top floor of the beautiful Victorian (freshly painted) building (originally from 1896). I have the best view of Japan Town and Twin Towers as well as complete privacy in my home. \n\nI love green plants and I have many in my home and at the balcony. I’ll be very grateful if you could please water it once a week ( just a little bit :) to keep it lush and green. \n\nSo far, I had wonderful guests from all over the world for the last ten years. I am super grateful for all people I met through AirBnB. \n\r\nPlease feel free to ask me any questions before you send a reservation. \r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting you in person and to host you in my home.\n \nThank you.

I personally restored this property, keeping as much of the original details that I could while creating a comfortable atmosphere with modern conveniences. I want guests to have an authentic San Francisco experience, and hope the space I have created will make you feel at home. \n\nBecause I have lived here for so long, I can provide guests with tips on sites and local restaurants that are off of the beaten path. I can also recommend neighborhood walks that expose guests to the historic and cultural charm that San Francisco has to offer. Since I often go to Napa and Sonoma, I have many recommendations of wineries that you may want to visit. \n\nI am proud of my adopted city and my home and want to share them with you. I hope that you can experience all the wonders of San Francisco that I am so lucky to enjoy everyday.\n\nIf you like my property, please add it to your Wish List!\n",

Our weekends in town often involve dance music, watching sporting events, and  doing activities like tennis and cycling to stay healthy together.

Among the things I enjoy are movies, reading, ballet, progressive thought, and conversation - especially over good food and wine, both out and at my table. \r\n \r\nYou'll be comfortable in my home if you're like previous guests and quite happy with the area you've chosen. My neighborhood is lively, centrally located, and provides plenty to do—if you want, I can recommend restaurants, cafes, theatres, shops and more.

I love traveling and hiking around here in the Bay area among other stuff that I do. Work and travel keep me busy.  \r\n\r\nProfessionally, I'm the founder and CEO of cheapesto.com , an early stage start up focused on international travel. I am an experienced entrepreneur and internet executive with special focus and emphasis on international travel. Proven track record of building and scaling profitable companies and lines of businesses. Most recently played a key role in taking Travix BV (www.vayama.com), an airline ticketing company from launch to multibillion dollar 20+ country success with 6+ brands in just short 5 years while generating serious profit. Focused on data driven innovation to make travel search and service simple, relevant and cost efficient.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm in town I'd love to get to know someone who may be visiting from out of country or for business. Most people who I have stayed here so far are tend to be professionals. I love learning and sharing about people, places, cultures and ideas. I'm passionate about consumer centric businesses, things and ideas that can help people in general in some form or the other. Academically I have crossed many disciplines from engineering to environmental science, energy management to finance and investment and worked in a few fields including venture capital and investment banking. I'm still learning not much through reading but more so through execution and conversation. \r\n\r\nLive more has been my way of living while having a less cluttered and more organized simple life style. If you ever happen to be my guest, you may enjoy a conversation over dinner or drinks. \r\n\r\nHappy travelling !",

Welcome to the Pierce Street Suite, which occupies the entire top-floor attic of a 1897 Queen Anne Victorian, right in the heart of San Francisco's Lower Haight.  The house was built  just a few years after street car service came to Haight Street.  The neighborhood was considered \"the country\"; the street car service opened it up to \"city\" residents.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />First, the space you'll be occupying: bright and airy, clean and cozy. The attic (formerly used for storage, guests, and a playroom complete with trapeze) was remodeled in October 2012. The original plan was that it would be occupied by the daughter of the house who had decided to return to San Francisco from Italy where she had lived for 12 years. However, love won out and she  returned to Italy in November  2012 for the Italian she left behind. She married the Italian twice in 2014 (once in SF and once in Italy) and a granddaughter was ",

I love meeting new people, but can assure you that you'll have plenty of privacy, as the Attic Suite is on the top floor and is quite separate from the main house. \r\n\r\nI travel often to Italy to visit my daughter  and granddaughter who is now 7. A long, long time ago, I spent two years living and teaching in Africa.  \r\n\r\nThis is a wonderful city and a dynamic, friendly neighborhood that I feel fortunate to live in and share. ",

        "host_about": "I have been a happy resident of San Francisco since 1994, living right here on McAllister St where I arrived after a former life-time married to a fine man, raising a family of three sons.\r\nI came for a visit and decided to stay......San Francisco does that to you.  I spent my early years here touring the city on inline skates, yes, hills and flat....great adventures, great friends, did the Friday Night Skate for years.   My work and rental property take my time and the fact that I now have 5 dear grandchildren living around the country means I travel rather often.  Now I walk everywhere with Muni as a backup.  SF is a great place to walk, you are never at a loss to find interesting places, beautiful buildings and lovely parks, beaches, trails, whatever your heart desires.  Good way to keep healthy, too, with yoga and gardening added for balance.  I have been renting rooms in my place since 1997 when I was able to purchase it.  I have had hundreds of people stay since then, many from other countries.  I have furnished rooms and cater to students, interns, people new to the city, beginning jobs.....a good place to get a start and figure out where you want to stay more permanently.  I try to make it a home away from home for them.  For me it is like having a large, ever changing family.\r\nBecause of the changing politics throughout the world, much of which is troubling,  as angry people take over governments and spread upset and anger about, I think it is valuable to have platforms such as Airbnb bringing people together from everywhere.  The chance to meet, talk, share a meal, converse with a group of people from different countries has to be good for our world.  I have a large map of the world in the living room and each guest puts a pin in the country from which they come.  It is thrilling to see the map fill and know that we have had good times with friends from all of those places!",

We also put together charters including anything from a wedding shuttle to 21 days around the Western National Parks.  We have been running our tour vans (and personal vehicle) on Biodiesel since 2003.  Since 2010, Brian and I have owned and run Dogpatch Biofuels, San Francisco's only 100% non-petroleum fueling station (we sell B20), which now has 24 hour access for fleets and individuals.  Recently we have been working to bring to market BioLighter, which is a non-petroleum based charcoal lighter fluid.  Other petroleum displacement products to follow.  We are active and love camping, mostly around California due to the demands of our businesses, love to travel, and bike all over San Francisco.  I love living in San Francisco for the ease of getting around, by bike, public transit and walking, and our home is in a great location to do all of these.  We love our neighborhood also for the park within walking distance, the restaurants and bars around the corner, grocery stores nearby, and many families in the area.  ",

I also contracted Covid 19 or a variant in May 2022 and fully recovered.\n\nSomething about me and my home; I’m gay, 64, single, very fit and energetic, very outgoing and easy going. I have always lived in California and have traveled the world extensively. I absolutely love San Francisco and even more being in the Mission District. Entrepreneurial spirited, at age twenty-one I started a business which fulfilled insurers’ responsibilities for auto losses involving vandalism and retired from that adventure just shy of 36 years later.  I have been vegan for four years now and I have redirected my culinary skills towards all things plant, sugar-free, and fat-free based cuisine.  I enjoy practicing yoga at Love Story just around the corner.  I am also an avid bicyclist and use my bike as my primary mode of transport in the city.  I am attending  Community College SF working my way to a zoological degree. Life is good.\n\nAs for my home, the location and views are arguably the best the Mission District can offer. The private roof deck, a green oasis for the otherwise concrete jungle of a Mission Street residence. My place faces west so it's on the street side and is usually quite noisy from people, traffic and sirens. Thankfully the residence was constructed in 2008 and  built  quite soundproof. The bedrooms are well sized and comfortably appointed. The sun always seems to shine in the Mission District.\n\nFinally, I love being an AirBnB host which allows me to share my good fortune, meet wonderful people and make new friends. \n\nI hope that you choose to stay. \n\nMark\n",

I volunteer for Airbnb in SF to help legalize home sharing. I love SF, Silicon Valley, The Wine Country, and welcome anyone also wanting to learn about life in Northern California. I'd be happy to leverage my extensive network to make your visit memorable. If I don't know exactly where to point you, I know someone who does. \r\n\r\nI've lived and worked in and around San Francisco since graduating from Cornell University where I studied business management and minored in hotel management. I have a background in technology, entrepreneurship, and fund raising. I'm a foodie, a  fitness fanatic, and am very active in the LGBT community. I sell enterprise software. \r\n\r\nI'm completely dedicated to 5 star stays and welcome your feedback before, during, and after your stay. \r\n\r\nMy dream is San Francisco Sept-December. Sydney January to March. Paris in April. Dublin in May. San Francisco in June. Napa or Palo Alto July August. I'm hoping AirBnB can help. Let's get started!\r\n\r\n",

It is a local adventure travel company that provides travelers and locals with trips to Yosemite, Wine Country and Muir Woods.  We also put together charters including anything from a wedding shuttle to 21 days around the Western National Parks.  We have been running our tour vans (and personal vehicle) on Biodiesel since 2003.  Since 2010, Brian and I have owned and run Dogpatch Biofuels, San Francisco's only 100% non-petroleum fueling station (we sell B20), which now has 24 hour access for fleets and individuals.  Recently we have been working to bring to market BioLighter, which is a non-petroleum based charcoal lighter fluid.  Other petroleum displacement products to follow.  We are active and love camping, mostly around California due to the demands of our businesses, love to travel, and bike all over San Francisco.  I love living in San Francisco for the ease of getting around, by bike, public transit and walking, and our home is in a great location to do all of these.  We love our neighborhood also for the park within walking distance, the restaurants and bars around the corner, grocery stores nearby, and many families in the area.  ",

I also love to dance-all kinds but Samba is my religion!\nFor an authentically Mission experience there is a free Salsa lesson included in your stay- I can teach you in 15 mins -yes  it's that easy or well,  just enough to fake the rest...\nI also love gardening, culture, fashion, camping, history and living in SF.\nFor 23 years, I owned one of the last Latin cultural stores in the community, it was a landmark legacy business which gave me a very intimate & spiritual connection to the Mission- hence why I  was  picked to film an Airbnb success story commercial you may have seen on u-tube called \n\"Airbnb Nancy\" - what a blast! \n I love showing guests the best of SF life, here are some of the best things to do beyond the touristy sights: \n-Bike along the embarcadero, across the GG bridge & take the ferry back from Sausalito- epic! \nbring some Napa or Sonoma Chardonnay with you &  on the  way stop at a crab stand at Fisherman's Wharf to pick up a very affordable crab sandwich on sourdough for the Quintessential San Francisco meal- have a picnic at Aquatic Park or Chrissy Field. \n-Hike Lands End \n-People watch at Dolores Park - best sunset view is at 20th & Church-don’t miss the irreverent Hunky Jesus (look a like) contest on Easter Sunday \n-Catch some blues at The Saloon in North Beach Sunday night \n-Eat a burrito in the Mission, Best in the US & do a self guided mural walk thru Balmy Alley & around. \n-Eat Dim Sum in Chinatown \nat the Hang ah Tea House & stop by The Fortune Cookie Factory nearby, (invented by a Japanese man)\n- Eat buffalo stew or burger at historical Tommy’s Joint & be transported back to the days of the Barbary Coast \n-ok The Cheese Cake Factory above Macy's Union Square can be a bit new money & a little touristy, but the food is actually pretty good & the view is AMAZING\n-The museum on the 2nd story of the Boudin Bakery in Fishermans Wharf is a little gem & you can see how the bread is being made into turtles, dolphons, crabs & other adorable animals.  After that head to Musee Mecanique a few doors away for antique arcade machines, relics left from Playland that used to be at Ocean Beach.\n-Play \"I left my Heart in San Francisco\" by Tony Bennett & read some Herb Caen, who coined the term \"Baghdad by the Bay\" \n-Have some coffee at Caffe Trieste in North Beach, where  the 1st Capuccino in the West was served  & also where Francis Ford Coppola wrote The God Father.\n- See the Zapatista Mural in Jack Kerouc Alley, painted by a dear friend &  behind iconic City Lights Bookstore .  Ask me about the mural story.\n-Catch a baseball game at Oracle park !\nSF songs & bands : \nCity Lights by Journey\nThe Grateful Dead of course\nHuey Lewis & the News \nCarlos Santana  & more !\n\nYou can also see the guide I made for Airbnb's  Mission Institutions:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/things-to-do/insider-guidebook/108?location=San%20Francisco%2C%20CA%2C%20United%20States&source=&currentTab=place_tab\n\n...p.s. once you know Salsa you also know Cumbia, Merengue, Bachata...\n\nhttps://airbnb.com/h/oceanbeachroomsanfrancisco\nhttps://airbnb.com/h/themissionroomsanfrancisco\nhttps://airbnb.com/h/thebuddharoomsanfrancisco",

        "description": "<b>The space</b><br />Location, location, location--Potrero Hill is where it's at!!! Potrero Hill is a great neighborhood in San Francisco bordered by SOMA to the north, the DogPatch to the east and the Mission to the west. It is centrally located and is less than 5 minutes from the major SF arteries--the Bay Bridge, 280 South and 101 South (only 20 minutes from the Golden Gate Bridge). It is also known as the sunniest spot in SF. If you're a baseball fan, we're just 5-10 minutes from the ballpark (so close you can walk to a ballgame). The unit is a clean, modern, fully functional studio apt located on the top (3rd floor). It is a mixed use development and the studio sits above a Whole Foods on the ground floor...very convenient! There are multiple restaurants within easy walking distance...a couple are \"3 Stars\" per Potrero Hill resident and food critic Michael Bauer. We're just a few blocks south of the Design Center and near major employers such as Zynga, AirBnB, Adobe, Autodesk, et",

Hard to believe, but I've been in the Bay Area for almost 30 years and living in San Francisco for 18 of those years! What's not to love about San Francisco!?! I think this sums it up...I used to get sad...maybe even depressed when returning home from a vacation. I have never felt that way since living in San Francisco. I could be anywhere in the world (Hawaii, Europe, etc.), and I always look forward to coming home to San Francisco. I'm an avid sailor and there is no back yard like the San Francisco Bay. Can you say \"America's Cup\" :-)",

My last amazing journey was to the Amazon. Even more memorable than the visual aspects of that trip were the auditory surprises. In addition to the contant vibrational buzzing and hissing in the air, I have 2 words for you, especially if you get to the Amazon: \"Howler Monkeys\". They truly sound like I imagine dinosaurs would sound. Apparently they get such volume and monster howl from a hole in a bone in their throats. Must be heard to be believed. But I digress! I'm a weekly dancer, pulling out the boots for two step, the retro wear for East Coast swing, and I waltz every chance I get no matter what I'm wearing. I love beautiful found objects. I write poetry and short stories. I have a private psychotherapy practice and teach mindfulness to people who are interested in more resiliency, more ZEST!  But I bet if you talked to my friends, they'd note the overall goofy, delighted way I like to carry on with life in general. As Helen Keller said, \"Life is a banquet, but most of us are starving to death.\" So I invite you to come to my home and take a big bite out of life. The time is now. \r\n\r\n",

We keep our space clean and pretty chill (no parties just occasional friends over) and peaceful!  Everyone always gets a great vibe from our place and rapport.  We hope you will too!   \r\n\r\nLove to meet travelers as I'm an avid traveler myself and have often stayed at private houses.  I find those are the best experiences.

The house is as colorful as the neighborhood is. The Mission is covered in murals and gorgeous paintings that tell stories. \r\n\r\nWe have two dogs that go with me to work and many guests don't even meet them because they are not around in common areas. They have very busy schedules as therapy dogs and they are happy to stay out of your way or greet you. If you'd like a meeting, please schedule it with their secretary (me). \r\n\r\nIf anything comes up during your stay, please just let us know. We are very accommodating. \r\n\r\n \r\n",

Thankfully my relatives enjoy visiting often. I hope to be able to visit them more in 2014. The more guests I have the easier it will be to make that a reality :) SO stay at my place!! \r\n\r\nI love to share my home with vacation rental guests. I have met so many kind and thoughtful people from all over the world. I grew up traveling frequently so now hosting brings the world to my door. YAY! It brings me great joy to have the opportunity to open my cherished home, and to share it with others. They can enjoy the space I have created and get to know San Francisco from the South of Market (SOMA) perspective. Right now SOMA really is the pulse of the city of San Francisco with all of the new restaurants, start ups, and wine bars. Not to mention SOMA is central to San Francisco highlights such as: Union Square, the Ball Park, the Cable Car ride, Westfield Mall and Market Street. It's even better to be one block from the Moscone Center, considering many of my guests are attending conferences during their stay! It is a pleasure to be able to offer everything at your fingers tips just steps away from my home and your home away from home.\r\n\r\nI have had a photography business for over 14 years where I support women to be their best. It is an honor and privilege to have photographed over 2,500 exceptional and inspirational women. As well as incredibly fun and heartwarming. \r\n\r\nThis coming semester I am studying Anatomy!\r\n\r\nI hope to have the chance to host you here in the loft or studio. Although I am not there during guests stay's I am easily reached to answer any questions. :)",

Thankfully my relatives enjoy visiting often. I hope to be able to visit them more in 2014. The more guests I have the easier it will be to make that a reality :) SO stay at my place!! \r\n\r\nI love to share my home with vacation rental guests. I have met so many kind and thoughtful people from all over the world. I grew up traveling frequently so now hosting brings the world to my door. YAY! It brings me great joy to have the opportunity to open my cherished home, and to share it with others. They can enjoy the space I have created and get to know San Francisco from the South of Market (SOMA) perspective. Right now SOMA really is the pulse of the city of San Francisco with all of the new restaurants, start ups, and wine bars. Not to mention SOMA is central to San Francisco highlights such as: Union Square, the Ball Park, the Cable Car ride, Westfield Mall and Market Street. It's even better to be one block from the Moscone Center, considering many of my guests are attending conferences during their stay! It is a pleasure to be able to offer everything at your fingers tips just steps away from my home and your home away from home.\r\n\r\nI have had a photography business for over 14 years where I support women to be their best. It is an honor and privilege to have photographed over 2,500 exceptional and inspirational women. As well as incredibly fun and heartwarming. \r\n\r\nThis coming semester I am studying Anatomy!\r\n\r\nI hope to have the chance to host you here in the loft or studio.

It has an open kitchen/living area with eating bar. Each bedroom has a large closet & a work desk. Lease can be 1 month to 1 year. Perfect for a group that is new to the area and needs a place to land with no hassle, or doesn't have their own furniture. An easy way get to know the City. Good wifi for working from home.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />All new electrical, plumbing, insulation, walls, fixtures, etc. Sleek, quiet, efficient electric heating in each bedroom with separate thermostats. New and cool bathroom with tons of bathroom storage. New oak hardwood floors (no, not that Pergo sh*t you see all the time -- actual hardwood installed by an old Italian guy!). Washer/Dryer in the unit. All new cabinetry, granite kitchen. Dishwasher, garbage disposal. Plenty of hallway and bedroom closet space.<br /><br />",
        "neighborhood_overview": "One hundred year ago, SoMa (or South-of-Market) was built with wide boulevards that held warehouses or factories on the corners and perimeter of each block. Nowadays, these are converted apartments or loft buildings.  The interior of the large blocks contained smaller street and were quiet \"Residential Enclaves\" of two- and three- story Edwardian flats, built with the last of the redwood from nearby forests in the 1910s and 20s. These enclaves today are hidden clusters of refurbished older homes that feel neighborly and almost private.  <br /><br />It's a highly walkable neighborhood with many bars, restaurants and clubs along the main roads, yet quiet and residential inside. Mid-SoMa, where we are, is very close to City Hall, a 1.5 block walk to Civic Center BART and Muni (which can get you anywhere in the region), easily walkable to Moscone Convention Center and the Financial and Hotel districts. Shopping at Union Square is about four blocks away!",

He will save the world by keeping our water clean. Yosh is an exuberant kid who is busy seeing how many minecraft worlds she can build and finding things to take apart and (hopefully) reassemble.  Jaya sees art in everything. She spends much of her time in her art studio creating works of art. The kids love to bounce on the trampoline and explore the world!\n\nWe love our neighborhood and the diversity it affords our city. Our favorite weekend morning activity is going to Philz coffee on the way to a local park. Yosh gets an opportunity to perfect his tricycling skills.\n\nOne of the perks about being teachers is that we are able to travel quite a bit. As a result, we have collectively been to over 35 countries. We also enjoyed a GAP year, and traveled around the world while in our early 30s. \n\nWe are delighted to open our home to you so that you can enjoy this fantastic city and fabulous neighborhood. \n\nWelcome!",

COVID chaotic guests disrupting our lives terribly made us suffer more than enough. I speak with ten years experience. Prior COVID I have served breakfast and dinner every day and I am sad that I can’t do it anymore but the heart the love and the overall integrity is intact. \nIf you know few things about Lebanese people, as I am one, family, values, generosity, insecurity, our priorities in our lives. That is what you will have in my home, a precious place that I have been living and growing with my children and hundreds of plants and trees for the last 29 years❤️\nWe all live great lives, I am a designer/manufacturer working in China since the 90s so it makes it impossible  to continue easily when anyone with special needs or hotel mentality book our bedrooms. Please make sure to understand that I run an extremely tight ship and have eyes on every detail. We attend all matters immediately not only caring for all and everything but to make sure that issues are stoped before they begin.\nOur home and neighborhood are extremely safe and as a designer with three amazingly gifted hard working adult children, we have designed this Jungle/Museum/Doll House and sanctuary. Clean air and environment, clean bathrooms and bedrooms are what awaits you, so welcome and enjoy these walls that express what I envision in my heart and soul as beautiful, all blending with art from different countries and periods in history, plants and colors❤️ \n\nWe are super blessed and protected by a team of four fantastic Christian humans that work for us and help us keep it all magnificently well and clean for over sixteen years, that trust and security is PRICELESS and if it is the Lord’s will, it will be yours too.\nOur home faces the Pacific Ocean, about 50 blocks away and when it is not foggy, our sunsets are dream-like! That said, the fog crawls up from the ocean and literally sits on top of our homes and neighborhood most of the time, specially during the summer, thus, I cannot express enough the importance the travel accordingly.\nThere will probably be other guests like you during your stay so we ask to whisper between 8 PM and 10 in the morning and if you’re going to be on the phone, you absolutely have to wear your headphones. Equally important is to notice that to enjoy good internet, as we all work online, we will ask that you choose ONE device for Wifi access. \n\nIn order to keep control of all details, my children and I personally are constantly here to help, explain and be of any assistance to you all, so to be informed of any and all needs you might have: we WILL TRULY do our maximum to accommodate you so always let US KNOW what you need, please!\n\nIn as much as the prices in our listings are concerned, we are happy to offer a rate that is at least 60% off in comparison to our  neighbors because we are blessed enough so love to share!\n\nI, the lucky mom and house owner, Lulu, speak eight languages, studying my ninth now and I am fortunate enough to travel around the world for business.\n\nWe look forward to sharing our lives with y’all! \nFYI, I go by “MamaLu” but my very favorite nickname is the “Creature From The Forest” :D\nWelcome!\nMamaLu",

The bright interior is completely renovated, combining charming Victorian details in the living and dining rooms with a large modern, fully-stocked kitchen featuring top of the line appliances and a wine refrigerator. There are 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, including the en-suite master bathr",
        "neighborhood_overview": "Our building is located in the centrally-located NOPA district filled with some of the most beautiful architecture in the City. We're only two blocks from the world famous Alamo Square and the Painted Ladies. A block away is the vibrant Divisadero corridor with its trendy restaurants, BiRite supermarket, a San Francisco institution and numerous coffee shops. <br /><br />We just minutes walking distance from the best outdoor spaces the City has to offer: Golden Gate Park begins at the Panhandle with its plethora of walking and biking paths, green meadows, groves and fields. The Park continues westward all the way to the Pacific ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge. On the way, you'll see flowers, bodies of water with resident ducks and geese, even a small herd of resident bison. Alamo Square Park is fast becoming the City's premier dog park, popular with picnicers. A little further away is Duboce Triangle Park, surrounded by classic Victorians and famous for its off-lease doggy area.",

I am a solar design engineer working in San Francisco, and Michael is a non-profit fundraiser and development director. While I am a relative newcomer to the City, Michael's been here 30 years. He is a font of information on all things cool happening in the City, while I am the handyman, geeky technology guy who keeps the house running - its (usually) a perfect match. We've gotten to really explore the City together and there always seems to be a new place to go see. A perfect day for us in the City: Hiking one of the many spectacular hiking and biking trails in the City or Marin Headlands, then a nice dinner at a trendy restaurant (even if its takeout), then a movie at home. Our apartment is kept immaculately clean and functioning, and we want our guests to feel warm and welcome. We enjoy a good relationship with our neighbors, so we're always careful to tell guests to be respectful of them also.",

        "neighborhood_overview": "I LOVE my neighborhood.  First of all, Alamo Square Park is just a block+ away.  It is a very historic park and most of you will recognize it for the views surrounding it.  It is a beautiful place to hang out and look at the scenery and includes a popular dog park.  The houses in my neighborhood are so interesting.  Many were built before the big earthquake and are lovely Victorians.  Since then, many other interesting homes of later origin were built.  Divisadero, one of the earliest routes of the Spanish, is now an 'entertainment corridor' according to neighborhood planners.  It is certainly a destination place for young people and affords all of us plenty of grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, clubs, cleaners, et al....most of what you need to keep supplied and entertained.",

        "host_about": "I have been a happy resident of San Francisco since 1994, living right here on McAllister St where I arrived after a former life-time married to a fine man, raising a family of three sons.\r\nI came for a visit and decided to stay......San Francisco does that to you.  I spent my early years here touring the city on inline skates, yes, hills and flat....great adventures, great friends, did the Friday Night Skate for years.   My work and rental property take my time and the fact that I now have 5 dear grandchildren living around the country means I travel rather often.  Now I walk everywhere with Muni as a backup.  SF is a great place to walk, you are never at a loss to find interesting places, beautiful buildings and lovely parks, beaches, trails, whatever your heart desires.  Good way to keep healthy, too, with yoga and gardening added for balance.  I have been renting rooms in my place since 1997 when I was able to purchase it.  I have had hundreds of people stay since then, many from other countries.  I have furnished rooms and cater to students, interns, people new to the city, beginning jobs.....a good place to get a start and figure out where you want to stay more permanently.  I try to make it a home away from home for them.  For me it is like having a large, ever changing family.\r\nBecause of the changing politics throughout the world, much of which is troubling,  as angry people take over governments and spread upset and anger about, I think it is valuable to have platforms such as Airbnb bringing people together from everywhere.  The chance to meet, talk, share a meal, converse with a group of people from different countries has to be good for our world.  I have a large map of the world in the living room and each guest puts a pin in the country from which they come.  It is thrilling to see the map fill and know that we have had good times with friends from all of those places!",

Alamo Square Park itself is a world renowned land mark, beautiful all year round and home of the famous \"Painted Ladies\" Victorian homes. Yet this area does not have the feel of a \"tourist trap\" area.<br />Our neighborhood is now a permit parking zone for street parking. This means that between the hours of 10am and 4pm there is 2 hour limit on street parking for cars without a permit. Parking is free and ample from 4pm to 10am (overnight).",

It is just about a 10 minute walk from the house.<br /><br />Mission is one of the most lively and colorful neighborhoods in the entire Bay Area and boasts some of the best warm and sunny weather in all of the city. From its wonderful world-class cuisine to its warm and welcoming residents, the Mission blends many different cultures and backgrounds, and exudes a vibrant spirit that can be felt by all who come here.<br /><br />Considered one of the most burgeoning areas in San Francisco, Hayes Valley’s rapid ascent as one of the Bay Area’s hippest neighborhoods can be attributed to the vast array of high-end boutiques, restaurants, and bars that populate the city plaza.",

Our apartment is located four blocks away from the main drag so it's central but also quiet...and there is PLENTY of street parking (unless there is a parade or something then it gets a bit harder but that's seldom).<br /><br />The underground Muni is a 5 minute walk, the 33 bus (also Muni) runs right in front of our house. There is a supermarket that stays open late, post office, 24 hour Walgreens, and a wide variety of restaurants to choose from. The Castro theatre and all the charm of the neighborhood is at your reach.<br /><br />The room boasts big south facing windows, hardwood floors, great closet, and desk that you could use to work as well. <br /><br />This neighborhood is perfect for those traveling without a car as it's convenient",

I am an actor and also do attorney work (mostly in Portuguese), teach dance and yoga (RYT 200), perform and co-create.  Love to travel and learn and improve communicating in different languages (English, Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, and Cape Verdean Creole....I just started learning German! and I also want to begin learning Quechua and Arabic!).  Love meditation, yoga, acro yoga, aerial yoga, being a vegan, all animals (including humans), mindfulness, nature, drawing, meditative doodling, music, chanting, singing, conscious and healing sounds, bootcamps ;-), and films that inspire or offer new perspectives, and reading....love reading!  And writing too!  I love jungles and humidity and never need airconditioning!  or even fans!  \r\n\r\nI will be traveling often this year so this seems like a perfect fit. \r\n\r\nAs our guest, you will have a lovely room, free washer (no dryer -- just air dry), wireless internet, shoeless household, and lovely roommates. We keep our space clean and pretty chill (no parties just occasional friends over) and peaceful!  Everyone always gets a great vibe from our place and rapport.  We hope you will too!   \r\n\r\nLove to meet travelers as I'm an avid traveler myself and have often stayed at private houses.  I find those are the best experiences.  Doing this is my way of keep the circle turning.  I hope that your stay with me will add to your fond memories of the lovely San Francisco!\r\n\r\n",

Since I started hosting in 2011, Airbnb has become a big part of my life. I am thrilled to have been a Host Educators at the Open in Paris in 2015 and honored to be asked back to be presenters at the 2016 Open in LA. I also started a company, Properly, to help hosts like myself convey turnover instructions to our helpers through a visual checklist app. It also provides a way for hosts to share,  find and train cleaners in their area. \n\nRunning a start up company is time consuming, but when I have down time, I love spending time in the outdoors, I am an avid  cyclist, kayaker and hiker.  I can't resist a gadget and my wife Evelyn and I love hosting dinner parties of all sizes - whether in a geodesic dome at Burning Man,  or in our home in Noe Valley.  I love traveling and I have called San Francisco home for over 20 years and love it. ",

She graduated from High School in 2019 & has taken a gap & COVID year before deciding on a university & country that she wants to go to school in. \n\nRenting our home also funded a new garden apartment that will be for a long term tenant.\n\nAirbnb also helped fund 'Tartlet Bar',  a food business Wendy had with her families farm.\n\nWe own the house together, but split our time there with Lita our daughter. We co-parent & raised our daughter in what’s called a “nesting” situation. One of us are usually in town & available if you need anything.\n\nWe have lived in San Francisco since 1989, we get out of the city as much as possible, but always seem to return.\n\nWendy is a creative consultant & avid paddle boarder. She speaks French, English, understands Spanish & is learning Portuguese. She's currently a digital nomad making her way around the continents. One of her passions is to see the world and study different cultures, which she has done extensively (she wants to be an anthropologist when she grows up ;.). \n\nWe believe the world is Lita's education, with 3 languages and several countries already under her belt she is a gypsy at heart. She’s fluent in French, Spanish, English, & is teaching herself Japanese. She took 2019/2020 to explore Europe & work in Japan before she attends a University in 2022.\n\nFred is French, fluent in French, English & Spanish, a photographer, entrepreneur, surfer, world traveler and owns two small business in SF; Dalva (a bar in the mission district) and Grenouille-French Vintage Antiques.\n\nWe're also doing Airbnb because we like the idea of meeting like minded travelers, people who seek adventure, people who believe we can learn from everyone we meet and enjoy absorbing other cultures as much as we do. Is it possible to be part of a community while being a gypsy and a nomad? So far it's working out to be yes...",

I retired from working downtown in Union Square; it takes very little effort to get there, three stops on MUNI. Our public-transit system is everywhere and very close to the house (be it a MUNI, the N Judah — underground — or the street car on Market Street). Our closest surrounding neighborhoods are Hayes Valley, Duboce Triangle, The Castro (just underwent extensive renovations), the Upper Haight and Valencia Street in the Mission District. On Waller Street we're literally steps away from some of the best food, bars and shopping (not tourist spots). The Lower Haight was voted the number one neighborhood in San Francisco by the tech community. Most important, do not rent a large car or let the car agency upgrade you to a larger car. Parking is too difficult. The rental agency tries to unload larger cars by offering visitors an upgrade. Don't accept it. I allow my guests to park in the street in front of my garage providing there is enough room.\r\n\r\nMy home (pre earthquake Edwardian) has been with me for more than forty years, so you can ask me anything that you want to know about the Bay Area and I am  bound to point you in the right direction. What else... Ah, just feel free to be in touch. I look forward to having you around! \rI just concluded my ninth year as a host on Airbnb. I am continually told that my price is too low. I am OK with my fee. I really want my guests to have a great time when staying in my home. To paraphrase the clothing designer Tom Ford, \" Surrounding yourself with beautiful objects, enhances the quality of your life\". It is my  unofficial motto. \n\nAfter hosting many guests from many different places, I learned that it is important to understand that when you book my home you are also experiencing my life. I have friends that stop by. I occasionally have people for dinner. It is essential to understand that I am not a professional innkeeper. I am not running a bed and breakfast. I am an Airbnb host who accept guests to stay in my guest bedrooms. I want my guests to live like residents of San Francisco. My neighborhood is very popular. When you stay with me you are returning to your San Francisco home.",

Best of all, you can take a morning hike with great vistas.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The lower unit of our two-unit house has an eat-in kitchen with morning sun, a living room with TV (no cable, limited channels, better if you have your own Netflix or similar streaming service), 1 bathroom, and 2 adjoining bedrooms with a queen bed and a full bed.  The bathroom and two bedrooms are adjoining, so the space is suitable for a couple or a family with young children.  (This means you have to walk through one bedroom to get to the other and also to the bathroom. The bedrooms are separated only by a sliding glass door.)<br /><br />The Bernal Heights neighborhood is great for walking around, getting a bite to eat, buying groceries, lounging at a cafe, or taking a short hike with views",

You can see the entire city with a 360 view, the Golden Gate and the Bay Bridge.  It is really quite spectacular.  There is also a smaller park about 6 blocks away that is great for laying around in the sun and people watching.  It has become the \"hip\" park in the city.  It is not uncommon to see a small casual wedding, funny hipsters trying to lay in the park in \"hip\" clothes and every other walk of life enjoying the sunshine with BBQs and picnics and frisbees.",

        "host_about": "AnneKarin was born in Chicago to Henry P. and Elly Glass.  Theirs was an artistic household.  Henry was educated in the Wiener Werkstadt and was one of the founders of the field of Industrial Design in the U.S.  Elly was a member of the Viennese Dressmakers’ Guild.  Both of them taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  AnneKarin grew up in Northfield IL and graduated from New Trier HS in 1961.  She received her BA in Anthropology from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1966 and joined the Peace Corps that same year.  She served as a Volunteer for three years in Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil, where she founded a leather working factory that provided steady work for local shoe makers.  Upon her return she went to Illinois Institute of Technology where she received an MA in Linguistics.\r\nShe tolerated the weather in Chicago until 1973 when she moved to San Francisco where Peace Corps friends facilitated her settlement into a new life on the West Coast.  Two months after she arrived she broke her leg in a ski accident and spent 11 months in a cast.  When able to walk again, she pursued a sign painting business which grew into a brokerage for architectural graphics.  From that she moved into print brokering, specializing in 3-D displays.  This enabled her to buy the house she was living in on Potrero Hill in San Francisco.\r\nThe recession in 1989 plus the introduction of computer technology into the world of print created a crossroad.  AnneKarin decided to give up the printing business and return to graduate school where she earned a graduate certificate in Educational Therapy.  She specialized in perception/cognition and opened a private practice, helping children and adults with learning disabilities to address the underlying causes of their learning problems.  \r\nDuring all these years AnneKarin continued to pursue visual art.  Today she works as an artist, focusing on the figure.  When no model is available she enjoys painting still lifes, abstracts, and landscapes.  She has shown her work internationally and in many competitions across the U.S.  She is a member of the Artists’ Guild of San Francisco.\r\nAnneKarin lives with Clebia, whom she met in Ilheus when she was a Peace Corps volunteer. Clebia is a case worker for intellectually challenged adults and a gourmet cook.  Clebia and AnneKarin enjoy travel, walking in the outdoors, fine dining, music, the ballet, who done-its, and old and new friendships. \r\n",

After teaching careers in Ann Arbor, Michigan, they have lived in SF since 1988 except for four years in Hong Kong when Joe was called on to help start a new Dept of Architecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. This project provided opportunities for new international friendships and foreign travel. During these Hong Kong years Betty completed and showed a series of large Paintings, based on images and stories from the South China Morning Post.

I'll be visiting him frequently, so why not.  \n\nTo be honest, we're a little nervous about renting out our home, because it is just that: our home. Two renovations and twenty years of futzing and we've got it exactly where we want it--to live and to retire. Fortunately, all remodeling choices were to made with the goal of sharing our home with our family and friends. I guess now we're just extending that circle a little further. \n\nOther socially relevant deets: I grew up in Memphis (high school: MUS), went to NCSU undergrad and MIT for business school.  In between I danced/acted in NYC (stage, not clubs. Well, both). I'm also an author of two business books and two novels (see Amazon).\n\nNick (Rubashkin) grew up in Maine and went to Brandeis for undergrad and Stanford for medical school. He did is residency at UCSF and practiced for 5 years at St. Lukes before receiving this Fulbright. He is also a published author of an anthology of Medical Students' personal stories (again, Amazon).\n",

Chestnut is the heart of the Marina district with fabulous restaurants, more shopping, movie theaters, and fitness gyms/studios. <br /><br />If walking, biking or running is your exercise of choice, a short 15 minute walk north will lead you to the Bay. You can walk all along the waterfront to Crissy Field and the Golden Gate Bridge.  Or, head south to Pacific Heights and Japantown and go west to check out the Presidio green space and smell the eucalyptus trees.  You can even walk or take a short bus ride to North Beach for gelato and espresso.<br />",

Since this is San Francisco, you get a front-row seat if you are lucky and the fog rolls in over Ocean Ave and right across Balba Park. It is quite a sight. <br /><br />Red Sea Market is 5 minutes away and has great pizza, and a good selection of beers, chocolate, ice cream, and wine. Whole Foods is a relaxing 15-minute walk through the park.<br /><br />Mission Street is a 10-minute walk and Glen Park is a 15-minute walk. There you will find some legendary bars and a plethora of restaurants. This is a booming area with wine bars popping up nearby and a brewpub that has live music most nights.<br /><br />Between Chenery Street, Ocean Avenue, and Mission Street you may not need to go to the tourist San Francisco to experience life here.<br /><br />This neighborhood rocks!

The place has plenty of charm and quirks, to experience the city like a true San Franciscan.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Full flat: a large unit at the top of Liberty Hill, near the Valencia corridor and with easy access to BART, MUNI, public transportation and freeways. <br /><br />The 4 rooms are independent. One holds a king size bed, two have a queen size bed and the last one has a queen size and also a set of bunk beds. There is a large dining table and even a grand piano. But keep your inner Beethoven in check, it's a middle floor with neighbors above and below. <br /><br />I live in this flat year round, and I host occasionally on Airbnb when I'm not around***. While you'll have the place to yourself, you won't be in a sterile hotel room",

COVID chaotic guests disrupting our lives terribly made us suffer more than enough. I speak with ten years experience. Prior COVID I have served breakfast and dinner every day and I am sad that I can’t do it anymore but the heart the love and the overall integrity is intact. \nIf you know few things about Lebanese people, as I am one, family, values, generosity, insecurity, our priorities in our lives. That is what you will have in my home, a precious place that I have been living and growing with my children and hundreds of plants and trees for the last 29 years❤️\nWe all live great lives, I am a designer/manufacturer working in China since the 90s so it makes it impossible  to continue easily when anyone with special needs or hotel mentality book our bedrooms. Please make sure to understand that I run an extremely tight ship and have eyes on every detail. We attend all matters immediately not only caring for all and everything but to make sure that issues are stoped before they begin.\nOur home and neighborhood are extremely safe and as a designer with three amazingly gifted hard working adult children, we have designed this Jungle/Museum/Doll House and sanctuary. Clean air and environment, clean bathrooms and bedrooms are what awaits you, so welcome and enjoy these walls that express what I envision in my heart and soul as beautiful, all blending with art from different countries and periods in history, plants and colors❤️ \n\nWe are super blessed and protected by a team of four fantastic Christian humans that work for us and help us keep it all magnificently well and clean for over sixteen years, that trust and security is PRICELESS and if it is the Lord’s will, it will be yours too.\nOur home faces the Pacific Ocean, about 50 blocks away and when it is not foggy, our sunsets are dream-like! That said, the fog crawls up from the ocean and literally sits on top of our homes and neighborhood most of the time, specially during the summer, thus, I cannot express enough the importance the travel accordingly.\nThere will probably be other guests like you during your stay so we ask to whisper between 8 PM and 10 in the morning and if you’re going to be on the phone, you absolutely have to wear your headphones. Equally important is to notice that to enjoy good internet, as we all work online, we will ask that you choose ONE device for Wifi access. \n\nIn order to keep control of all details, my children and I personally are constantly here to help, explain and be of any assistance to you all, so to be informed of any and all needs you might have: we WILL TRULY do our maximum to accommodate you so always let US KNOW what you need, please!\n\nIn as much as the prices in our listings are concerned, we are happy to offer a rate that is at least 60% off in comparison to our  neighbors because we are blessed enough so love to share!\n\nI, the lucky mom and house owner, Lulu, speak eight languages, studying my ninth now and I am fortunate enough to travel around the world for business.\n\nWe look forward to sharing our lives with y’all! \nFYI, I go by “MamaLu” but my very favorite nickname is the “Creature From The Forest” :D\nWelcome!\nMamaLu",

Before the advent of Airbnb, we hosted exchange students from France, Spain, and Paraguay, and hosted guests from North Africa, along with family from other parts of the U.S. and Mexico.  We love cooking (and eating).  We can help  you find the best food from fine-dining, to hip dining, to casual comfy to food trucks.  We love a broad range of music, and we can steer you in the direction of live music offerings.  We see it as our obligation to be present when you need us, and (nearly) invisible when you do not.

I  love walking, hiking and biking in the nearby parks and visiting the neighborhood museums and restaurants.  \r\n\r\nI'm a trained mediator and also teach English as a Second Language (certified by Cambridge University) and am pleased to give you tips for visitors from other countries (or private English lessons, at a discount!)   \r\n\r\nI love to travel myself (next goal is Egypt and Jordan), and try to treat all guests as I like to be treated when away from home.   \r\n\r\nMy goal is to give each guest all the privacy that they prefer.  I'm available if you'd like, or will respect your private sanctuary if that's your preference. \r\n\r\n I hope you'll love living like a local in San Francisco as much as I do!",

I'm artistic, but not eccentric!\n\nWhen I was in college, I spent an incredible year studying in Italy and touring Europe and more recently have had the opportunity to visit several countries. Australia and Antarctica are the only two continents left!\n\nPersonal safety is important to me, so if you are new to our city, I can give you tips on where to go and what areas to avoid. If you’re up for an urban adventure, I can also help you because when I travel, I like to go to the places that are typically not found in the guidebooks. \n\nI’m an animal lover, which in my mind means I am someone that’s empathetic, conscientious and fun-loving. My dog is a rescue from an animal shelter. He loves people and he will come up to say hi if you want. But like me, he'll respect your privacy if you don't want him around.\n\nHaving traveled quite a bit, I always find myself grateful for a friendly face or guidance in a new place, and am happy to return the favor to my guests. My partner, Vince and I are just downstairs so chat me up if you need me. I’m glad to leave you alone if you don’t. Either way, just feel at home!\n\n ",

In spite of all the recent gentrification the community is still 48% Latino. <br />Though the Mission still retains it's gritty 'barrio' (hood) flavor the neighborhood has been undergoing a second wave of gentrification though I think there is still plenty of SF soul left to go around, maybe now you just have to know where to ",

I also love to dance-all kinds but Samba is my religion!\nFor an authentically Mission experience there is a free Salsa lesson included in your stay- I can teach you in 15 mins -yes  it's that easy or well,  just enough to fake the rest...\nI also love gardening, culture, fashion, camping, history and living in SF.\nFor 23 years, I owned one of the last Latin cultural stores in the community, it was a landmark legacy business which gave me a very intimate & spiritual connection to the Mission- hence why I  was  picked to film an Airbnb success story commercial you may have seen on u-tube called \n\"Airbnb Nancy\" - what a blast! \n I love showing guests the best of SF life, here are some of the best things to do beyond the touristy sights: \n-Bike along the embarcadero, across the GG bridge & take the ferry back from Sausalito- epic! \nbring some Napa or Sonoma Chardonnay with you &  on the  way stop at a crab stand at Fisherman's Wharf to pick up a very affordable crab sandwich on sourdough for the Quintessential San Francisco meal- have a picnic at Aquatic Park or Chrissy Field. \n-Hike Lands End \n-People watch at Dolores Park - best sunset view is at 20th & Church-don’t miss the irreverent Hunky Jesus (look a like) contest on Easter Sunday \n-Catch some blues at The Saloon in North Beach Sunday night \n-Eat a burrito in the Mission, Best in the US & do a self guided mural walk thru Balmy Alley & around. \n-Eat Dim Sum in Chinatown \nat the Hang ah Tea House & stop by The Fortune Cookie Factory nearby, (invented by a Japanese man)\n- Eat buffalo stew or burger at historical Tommy’s Joint & be transported back to the days of the Barbary Coast \n-ok The Cheese Cake Factory above Macy's Union Square can be a bit new money & a little touristy, but the food is actually pretty good & the view is AMAZING\n-The museum on the 2nd story of the Boudin Bakery in Fishermans Wharf is a little gem & you can see how the bread is being made into turtles, dolphons, crabs & other adorable animals.  After that head to Musee Mecanique a few doors away for antique arcade machines, relics left from Playland that used to be at Ocean Beach.\n-Play \"I left my Heart in San Francisco\" by Tony Bennett & read some Herb Caen, who coined the term \"Baghdad by the Bay\" \n-Have some coffee at Caffe Trieste in North Beach, where  the 1st Capuccino in the West was served  & also where Francis Ford Coppola wrote The God Father.\n- See the Zapatista Mural in Jack Kerouc Alley, painted by a dear friend &  behind iconic City Lights Bookstore .  Ask me about the mural story.\n-Catch a baseball game at Oracle park !\nSF songs & bands : \nCity Lights by Journey\nThe Grateful Dead of course\nHuey Lewis & the News \nCarlos Santana  & more !\n\nYou can also see the guide I made for Airbnb's  Mission Institutions:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/things-to-do/insider-guidebook/108?location=San%20Francisco%2C%20CA%2C%20United%20States&source=&currentTab=place_tab\n\n...p.s. once you know Salsa you also know Cumbia, Merengue, Bachata...\n\nhttps://airbnb.com/h/oceanbeachroomsanfrancisco\nhttps://airbnb.com/h/themissionroomsanfrancisco\nhttps://airbnb.com/h/thebuddharoomsanfrancisco",

We have traveled extensively in Europe and South America and welcome international and national guests.  We love living in San Francisco and taking full advantage of the geographic, social and cultural activities it has to offer. Our home is I a perfect location to easily explore the city and its intriguing, diverse neighborhoods.

Perfect for couples/business travelers.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Please note: the couch in the living room has been replaced by a daybed not yet updated in the photos!<br /><br />This elegant 1BR/1BA receives bright natural lighting throughout at all times of day.<br /><br />The Bedroom:  The king-size platform bed and gray monochromatic color scheme lend the room a zen-like sense of calm.

        "neighborhood_overview": "If there's any area of San Francisco that evokes images of the long-gone '60s hippie culture, the Haight is it. Fragments of that flower-power, incense-burning, acid-dropping, tie-dye-wearing, peace-and-love-vibing era can be purchased at smoke shops and Eastern-influenced outlets bearing names like Dreams of Kathmandu and The Love of Ganesha. But save for a few hippie relics, the Haight today is a whole new scene. Exclusive boutiques, high-end vintage-clothing shops, second-hand stores, Internet cafés and hip restaurants have all settled in, making the Haight one of San Francisco's commercial centers.<br /><br />Neo-punks, club kids, fashionites, tourists and neighborhood folks are equally at home here, whether they have come to get a new piercing, grab a burrito, find the latest drum 'n' bass 12-inch or just people-watch from a café. But there are two distinctly different areas of the Haight: The Upper Haight, which stretches from Stanyan to Masonic, is the more moneyed shopping zone",

Typically the Sunset is foggy for June and July, but is clear most other days of the year.  Typical yearly temperatures hover in the 60-65 degrees Fahrenheit.  Our neighborhood is a friendly community, where most of us know each other by name and many natives still live in the area. The sunset district is like the \"suburbs of the City\", making it a more relaxed environment with all the benefits of a big city and entertainment at your fingertips.  Golden Gate Park (GGP) is within walking distance (1 mile) and holds the Outside Lands concert and the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival. GGP also has the Academy of Science museum, De Young art museum, and Japanese Tea Garden. The Great Highway offers a beautiful 5 mile walking path from Sloat ave. to the Cliff House/Sutro Baths.
